# Introduction
This tool offers a way to estimate transcript abundance without the use of reference databases for metatranscriptome data.

# The Model
We assume that all reads coming from a transcript are uniformly distributed along the transcript (although it is not true in reality)

# License
This tool for de novo metatranscriptome analysis is released under GPLv3.
