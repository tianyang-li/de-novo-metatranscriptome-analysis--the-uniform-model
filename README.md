# Introduction
This tool offers a way to estimate transcript abundance without the use of reference databases for metatranscriptome data.

# The Model
We assume that all reads coming from a transcript are uniformly distributed along the transcript (although it is not true in reality)

# Dependencies
[Berkeley DB](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/berkeleydb/overview/index.html), 
[bsddb3](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bsddb3), 
[Biopython](http://biopython.org/wiki/Main_Page), 
[HTSeq](http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/doc/overview.html), 
and [SciPy](http://scipy.org/) need to be already installed.

# License
This tool for de novo metatranscriptome analysis is released under GPLv3.
